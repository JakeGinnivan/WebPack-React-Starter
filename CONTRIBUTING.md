# CONTRIBUTING
Because this repo rewrites history it is a little different to most. First create an issue with your suggestion, this will normally be something like this:

```
When adding Redux in, I suggest we make this config change:

- some config line
+ replace with this
```

I'm not sure the best way to write this up at the moment but we can play it by ear. If it sounds like a good idea then push the rewritten branch to your fork and post a link to it in the issue. A maintainer of this repo will then reset the branch to the branch in your fork then force push.

This means that if two people make different changes at the same time, both cannot be merged in and someone will have to do it. If this repo starts getting enough contributions that this is an issue then we will cross that bridge then.
