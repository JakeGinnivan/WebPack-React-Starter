To rebase this branch run `git rebase -i "6ebd7a5f8779d997bb221c4e12ace33f58292455"`

## How we got here
### 1. Initial configurations
Not much happening here, but we want to start with some decent defaults

 - .vscode/settings.json - I'm using VSCode so adding some configs now
 - `.eslintrc` - Airbnb has a great ESLint config, it adds React rules but we are using react soon so lets do it. Also no semi-colons..
 - `.editorconfig` - So anyone opening the project uses the right type of spacing
 - `.gitattributes` - Tell git how to handle line endings on the project
 - `package.json` - Yep..
